# tmux configuration
## OS X

I make use of reattach-to-user-namespace pbcopy to get tmux buffer selection into
the OS X system clipboard. 

## Ubuntu
For Ubuntu, I use xclip to insert the tmux buffer selection into the system clipboard.

## TODO

* [ ] Start your tmux configuration from scratch and only add what you really need and what works.
* [ ] Use the same tmux version across platforms.
